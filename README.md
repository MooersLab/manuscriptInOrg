# Generic template in Org-mode for the first submission of an academic manuscript as a PDF

This is an org-mode variant of the main.tex file in the MooersLab/manuscriptInLaTeX [repo](https://github.com/MooersLab/manuscriptInLaTeX).

Git clone the repo and open the main.org file in Emacs.
Enter `C-c C-e l o` to compile and open the resulting PDF in your default PDF viewer.
It takes several seconds on a 2018 MacBook Pro with 32 GB of RAM.
